            <div class="about-mediTriage-content">
                MediTriage is a simple, intelligent self-triage tool designed to help people understand their symptoms and choose the right level of care. Instead of guessing whether a condition requires home care, a clinic visit, or emergency attention, MediTriage guides users through a structured symptom check and provides clear, practical recommendations.

            <div class="how-it-works-content">
            By asking a series of simple questions about your symptoms, MediTriage can quickly assess the severity of your condition.<br><br>
            <b><b>For example:</b></b>
            if you have a fever, cough, and body aches, MediTriage might suggest home care with rest and fluids. If you have chest pain or difficulty breathing, it would recommend seeking emergency care immediately. By providing personalized advice based on symptoms, MediTriage empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and ensures they receive the appropriate care when they need it most.<br><br><br><br>
